##District Trivia

This is a true false ("alternative facts") trivia game that tests your knowledge on a variety of DC related questions.
Simply answer true or false for each question and hit Go! to submit.

##Requirements for project
Your app must:

1. Render in the browser

3. Stick with KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
4. Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
5. Deploy online, using Github Project pages.
6. Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Trivia Specific:
1. Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.

2. Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

##Goals/Approach
1. Have a set of questions that upon click, appear one at a time.
2. Evaluate the answer the user gives against actual answer and determine true/false
3. Prompt set responses for correct and incorrect answers
4. Have the game award points for correct answers
5. Track the player's s core throughout the round
6. Prompt final score upon completion of last question
7. Make a good looking app!
